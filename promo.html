        <p>
          I created Lullaby Yoga® in one of the most difficult times in my life, to help myself recover from a terrible
          car
          crash. My doctor told me I would not practice yoga the same way again so I developed this new form of yoga as
          a
          way that I could practice and heal safely. Surprisingly quickly, my debilitating pain, headaches, and brain
          fog
          vanished, and I felt more peace of mind and soul-connection than ever before in my life.
        </p>
        <p>Soon, I began sharing
          Lullaby Yoga® with friends and yoga students. Their extraordinary positive experience led me to take Lullaby
          Yoga® on the road to offer it at festivals, spiritual centers, yoga studios, retreat centers, and workshops
          around the
          US.

        Lullaby Yoga is like eating dessert, it’s just delicious. A special treat for a special
        evening. My clients and I love being tucked into restorative postures and sung into a sweet dreamlike trance
        by Johanna. It’s just the best way to spend a Friday night that I can imagine.

        Lullaby Yoga is a beautiful fusion of Johanna's music medicine with restorative yin yoga asana. Every class
        which I have experienced with Johanna has been unique.
        From the large bhakti crowds to the small studios,
        Johanna welcomes everyone and creates a safe,
        all-inclusive environment for healing. Her beautiful heart vibe attracts world-known kirtan artists who
        often accompany her during class and can be enjoyed on one of her many lovely recorded offerings.

        Johanna’s presence on the mic, as a teacher, yogini, devotional human being, musician and all
        around bad ass, helps me melt into a more receptive, humble and serene state. My time spent with her enjoying
        Lullaby Yoga was very healing, nourishing, replenishing and vitalizing. I find her approach to artfully
        combining music and yoga encourages my nervous system to let go deeply, surrender into my breath and soften my
        entire being.It’s like combining the best things about being an infant, with the mystery and wisdom of
        adulthood… For anyone considering this journey into Lullaby Yoga, I would say it’s the bomb and you should
        most definitely do it without hesitation! Totally worth it.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p>Q: How can something so gentle work so well?</p>
    <p>A: Although in our culture we have the mindset that "stronger, faster, stronger" is better, current research
      proves thevalue of restorative yoga for healing and rejuvenating your body, mind and soul.</p>
    <p> Q: I usually have a hard time relaxing. Will this work for me?</p>
    <p>A: Many people find that although they struggle to relax on their own, they can easily and deeply relax while
      being guided through soothing music and gentle instruction of Lullaby Yoga®.</p>
    <p>Q: I’m very busy. How much time does this take?</p>
    <p>A: This series has been designed especially for people with busy schedules! Each Lullaby Lesson is less than 20
      minutes.</p>
    <p>
      Q: Is this good for children?</p>
    <p>
      A: Although Lullaby Yoga® is primarily a healing, self-care practice for adults, many parents find that their

    <p>A: You can do it in a very small bit of space inyour bedroom, living room - or you can even do it in bed!</p>
    <p>Q: I already have a yoga practice I love. Why do I need this?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Most yoga practitioners love adding variety to their regular practice. Lullaby Yoga® is great as a

      tired, stressed or depleted, or when you are recovering from an illness.
    </p>
    <p>Q: I already practice restorative yoga. What’s different about this?
    </p>

      can fully receive the healing benefits of the pose and the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: I have a medical condition. Can I do Lullaby Yoga®?
    </p>
